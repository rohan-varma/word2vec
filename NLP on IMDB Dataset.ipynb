The Cowboy and \\\"Twig\\\" ride up the ridge. The Cowboy has a handle bar mustache. The Cowboy and \\\"Twig\\\" get into a shoot out and race half way down the ridge. The Cowboy is clean shaven through out the rest of the film. Sometime between the gun fight and the ride down the mountain the cowboy has had time to shave, in dark, on the back of a horse.<br /><br />To be fair, the acting by the four main characters is solid.\"\n"
